# MalincheJS

MalincheJS is a tool for internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) in node and js. The name was chosen for honoring [La Malinche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Malinche), she served as interpreter for Hernan Cortez during the [Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Aztec_Empire) and although her historical role is subject to discussion and somewhat polemic, there is no doubt about their linguistic skills. 

The goal is to make i18n and l10n as fun as possible, abstracting all things not related for programming, like linguistics, tooling, etcetera. 

## Objectives

- Create a JSON alternative for [XLIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLIFF) (XML Localization Interchange File Format).
- Offer JIT (Just In Time) and AOT (Ahead Of Time) compilation.
- Be framework independent (Priority but at this time I am developing it with Angular).
- Offer i18n and l18n for both strings and assets.

## Status

The project is at a very early stage but any comment or suggestion is welcome. You can contact me here, at [@MigsarNavarro](https://twitter.com/MigsarNavarro) or by email (migsar.navarro at gmail).

Being Spanish my first language I cannot avoid to focus on getting a fully functional version for Spanish and English, but I would love to include any other language subtleties in the design.
